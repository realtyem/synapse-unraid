# While typically coturn's UDP relay ports can number in the several(ten's) of thousands,
# we are using docker containers, which are notorious for not liking large ranges of ports.
# The default is 49152-65535 as a range. I'm sure you aren't going to be supporting over
# 4,000 clients at the same time, so a more limited range of UDP relay ports is appropriate.
# If you need to handle more than, say, 12 people's VoIP at the same time, install coturn as
# a separate docker image and make it's network 'host' and you'll have a better time.
#
# Useful info on ports:
# https://about.att.com/sites/broadband/network (down near the bottom)
#
# Check with your ISP for documentation on which ports they block, like 25, 139, 3479, 49152
#
# On your router, forward port 5349(for both TCP and UDP) to your UNRaid machine's static IP. Also
# forward ports 49153-49173 for UDP only to the same UNRaid static IP.
#
# Expose port 5349 on the synapse container to host port 5349 in the synapse template for both TCP and UDP.
# Additionally, expose ports 49153-49173 for UDP only in the same template. Those can be expressed as a
# range(with the same dash like here)
#
# Synapse VoIP traffic is all UDP, so disallow TCP. Notice the 'relay' part of that option.

# don't let the relay ever try to connect to private IP address ranges within your network (if any)
